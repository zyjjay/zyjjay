## Hey! 👋

### I'm Jason, a fourth-year `Computer Engineering` student at the University of Toronto 🇨🇦

I just wrapped up my internship as a SWE at Red Hat, where I worked on cluster management and security. I will return back to school for my final year at UofT this fall, where I'll be exploring my interest in the fields of computer systems, machine learning, and networking.

If any of the things I've worked on are of interest, feel free to reach out! I'm currently seeking 2025 opportunities.

- 💡 What I've worked on:
  - **Projects @ Red Hat**:
    - Collaborated on the development of a new event-driven controller to streamline the installation process and enhance the observability of Community Kubernetes Operators across thousands of clusters
    - Implemented secure serving of Prometheus metrics via SSL/TLS, and handled infrastructure changes such as routing due to the deprecation of the sidecar proxy
    - Spearheaded the effort to extend our GitOps capabilities by adding support for Docker image overrides, allowing integration tests to be run on every PR across 4+ repositories to catch failures before build stage 
  - **NFTracker**: React web app to retrieve and display data about NFTs using the OpenSea API 
  - **Spacetagram**: Instagram clone for astronomy pictures using NASA's APOD API
  - **Mappr**: Google Maps clone made with OpenStreetMap API and GTK
  - **Jason Zhang CV**: Personal portfolio website
